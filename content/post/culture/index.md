There is a LOT to do, many many ways to engage with the heart of Chile.

There are so many cool museums. If you are someone that appreciates physical artefacts of history and art, then you will be very happy visiting Santiago. There is a vast array of different museums, each fitting very different themes.

Three that stand out in my memory are:
- Museum of Fine Arts
- Museum of National History
- Museum of Memory and Human Rights

The first two are rather fun to visit, and you could probably spend the whole day in either one of them, provided the right timing. Unfortunately for me, it seems my vists to both of these museums were curtailed by the staff cordoning off large sections. Still, this gave me more time to appreciate the select pieces I did see.

The last one is really impactful to visit, but weighed on me heavily. I would suggest planning and giving yourself time afterwards to regain your balance if you are disturbed easily.

There are also tons of other musuems, like the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art, as well as many sites dedicated to Nobel Prize-winning authors like Pablo Neruda's houses or the Gabriela Mistral Cultural Center.

You can also just walk along the central road, it's very walkable, and just bask in the glory (and air pollution) of the city. You can walk past places infused with rich history like the La Moneda Palace, and the Church of San Francisco.
