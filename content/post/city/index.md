## Introduction

Santiago is a very metropolitan, walkable city with a lot of cool stuff to do and see.

## Getting Around

As I mentioned, Santiago is *walkable*! This was one of my favourite aspects of the city, just walking around with friends, especially if you're situated in Santiago Centro, you can get to some very nice places with less than an hour of walking.

Public Transit infrastructure is also very good, and having a bip! card is essential to using their excellent metro infrastructure. With it, you can get around even farther, and with enough practice you'll feel like a local.

## Communication

The most commonly spoken, and official language in Chile is Spanish. Most people don't speak English, but they are quite kind and accommodating of non-native speakers. I do not know Spanish. I speak, among other languages, English and French. I switched my Duolingo language (currently at a streak of 1095 days) to Spanish for the past month, and it helped me pick up some basic vocabulary, especially since I was already somewhat familiar with the grammar structures through French.

What is far more helpful is having a phone with Google Translate Offline translations downloaded, and a friend that speaks Spanish (and doesn't mind intervening when you're about to say that the waiter wants a salad instead of you).

## Transacting

Travelling takes spending money, and Santiago is very eager to take your money! The vast majority of establishments, even tiny pop-up coffee stands, accept contactless card payments. It is even more convenient if you enable contactless payments on your smartphone of choice, as you can just tap-to-pay (an innovation pioneered by the people behind the London Underground). Still, it's never a bad idea to carry cash, just not too much at once.

## Safety

Speaking of smartphones, you _definitely_ want to be careful; theft is not unheard of. I would really recommend getting a good, sturdy case and lanyard to deter theft. Santiago is a nice city, but you definitely need to keep an eye out, especially at night, especially if you're in a large group drawing attention.
