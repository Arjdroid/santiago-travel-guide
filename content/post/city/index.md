# Introduction

Santiago is a very metropolitan, walkable city with a lot of cool stuff to do and see.

# Getting Around

As I mentioned, Santiago is *walkable*! This was one of my favourite aspects of the city, just walking around with friends, especially if you're situated in Santiago Centro, you can get to some very nice places with less than an hour of walking.

Public Transit infrastructure is also very good, and having a bip! card is essential to using their excellent metro infrastructure. With it, you can get around even farther, and with enough practice you'll feel like a local.

# Coffee

I didn't come into Santiago with very high expectations regarding coffee, but my first few hours in the city proved me delightfully wrong. The city has an excellent coffee culture.
