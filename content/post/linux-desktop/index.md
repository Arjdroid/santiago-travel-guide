I think it may finally be the year of the Linux Desktop.

Of course, the community has been crying wolf in this regard for over a decade, but from the standpoint of my own personal experiences, it is true now.

This summer, I've come back from university and the summer itself has been split into two halves. The first half was spent at home, remotely taking a systems programming course, while the latter half I've been in South America. In the former, my primary computer was my home desktop. Returning to it after 9 months, I found Windows 11 to be overly opinionated and restrictive, I had no patience for it. I loaded up the latest Fedora Workstation ISO and immediately felt more at home. I was able to do everything. Gaming via Steam + Proton, general browsing on Firefox, all my coursework via nvim + kitty, and any other random tasks I needed a computer for like editing photos, watching movies etc. 

I did not find Fedora lacking in any regard, although I should stipulate that I finally succumbed to the pressure and purchased a relatively inexpensive Intel AX-200 based Wi-Fi adapter to alleviate the perpetual Wi-Fi and Bluetooth driver issues plaguing me after each kernel upgrade (thanks a lot Realtek...)

What is far more interesting in my opinion, however, is my experience with Fedora while travelling South America. As part of a study-abroad program, I'm with my professor and a dozen classmates studying Latin American Literature while visiting the very houses of the authors and museums containing pieces about which we read.

- android also counts??? (pixel9p on stock os, kernel 6.x),
    - google pixel is now more of my primary compute platform haha, photography, navigation, translation, web searches, hackernews (Hacki is a great app), AI queries, | I even tried writing some coursework on the phone via Google Docs, and its not half bad, but nothing beats the Thinkpad keyboards
- thinkpad has been surprisingly good, I left my trusty MacBook back home
    - technical limitations of the thinkpad have ironically (much like the reMarkable) improved my quality of life
    - as much as I like gaming, enjoying real life has been a lot more immersive (also probably a lot better for my longevity and again qol)
    - t480s struggling to play hevc video from dji drone, my memories of the hikes are more important

- I'm liking this so much, I'm almost considering, almost, just taking the T480s with me and leaving the MBA at home when at university haha
