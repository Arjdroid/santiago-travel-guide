## Introduction

Santiago, as a large city, has a lot of great food options.

## Coffee

I didn't come into Santiago with very high expectations regarding coffee, but my first few hours in the city proved me delightfully wrong. The city has an excellent coffee culture. There are all these cute cafes dispersed across the city, and you are never more than 3 minutes away from an espresso machine. Available are a very many different blends and great roasters however, I was a little disappointed to note that none of them had laid their eyes on decaf, and lighter roasts were hard to find.

## Vegetarian

As a vegetarian, I once more didn't come with very high expectations as to what I could eat. Yet again, I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Every place has at least one substantial menu item, usually more that is vegetarian or perhaps even vegan. There is also a great selection and rich history of purely vegetarian / vegan restaurants, granted they are a tad bit more on the expensive side, and often located in nicer parts of the city that just so happen to be less accessible by the subway. One such really nice restaurant is El Huerto.

## Fast

There is a lot of food that you can very fast. Interestingly enough, 'traditional' American fast food chains like Burger King are rather slow to service orders due to constantly running beyond capacity. Instead, check out some local alternatives: Empanadas are a must try.
