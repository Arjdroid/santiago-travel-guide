## Introduction

While the city itself is great, sometimes you want to escape the hustle and bustle, not to mention pollution.

Climb up one of the mountains you see.

One of my favourite parts of Santiago is that you can see the mountains in all directions surrounding you!

I was a little rusty with hiking and adventure sports before coming here, but every weekend held something new for me.

From hiking 20+km up Cajon Del Maipo in meter-deep snow, to being carried by a river holding onto a boogie-board for dear life, or paragliding the coasts of Valparaiso, there is much to do within a couple hours of Chile.

I would highly recommend seizing the opportunity to step out of your comfort zone, and partaking in any adventure that catches your fancy.

I relished the time away from my screens, whether it be multiple monitors or a laptop or the relatively tiny smartphone. Still, I took a lot of pictures I really liked so perhaps my camera makes the cut.
