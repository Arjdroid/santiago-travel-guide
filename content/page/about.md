## About Me

Hi! I'm Arjun, a Computer Engineering Major at UCSD's Revelle College, class of 2028. I recently took part of the Global Seminar 'Revelle in Santiago' in which I stayed in Santiago de Chile for a month, with 25+ of my fellow Revellians. We attended lectures, visited museums, went on fun adventures and did our coursework.

## About The Website

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a relatively simple, open-source engine for building great static HTML websites.

The Hugo theme that I am using is [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/), by [Jimmy Cai](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/)

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) (specifically, Github Pages), a fantastic resource enabling open-source content to be distributed accessibly worldwide.

Most of the edits were made in [neovim](https://neovim.io) a command-line based text editor.

All the photographs that appear on this website are shot by me, either on a Sony RX-100 II or my Google Pixel 9 Pro.

I am the sole rights holder for all copyrightable content on this website including, but not limited to, the images and text.
